# Music-Generate-Part1

## Introduce
RNN is a kind of sequence to sequence model, it can solve a lot of NLP problems such as  Machine translation 、 Summarization 、
and even can generate article. <br> This time I am going to use RNN to generate music, similar to Article generation we can convert music
into notes and durations then we can treat them as the input of RNN. <br>
But the problem of RNN is that it only allows fixed length of inpurt sequence, so I introduced Attention mechanism to solve this problem.
